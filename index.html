  <h2 id="tribute-info">About Flavia</h2>
  <ul class="list">
    <li><em>She's fuzzy.</em> Flavia's fur is soft and fuzzy. It's perfect for petting, scratching, and hugging.</i>
    <li><em>She's orange.</em> Orange cats are the best! That's why it's no surprise that Flavia is one.</li>
    <li><em>She's adorable.</em> I don't think there's much doubt about how adorable she is. Look at that kitty!</li>
    <li><em>She's lazy.</em> Flavia is also very lazy, but she's a cat, so she gets away with it.</li>
    <li><em>She's silly.</em> She loves doing wacky things like running randomly through the apartment.</li>
    <li><em>She's grumpy.</em> Only when she's been waiting for food for more than 30 seconds, that is.</li>
    <li><em>She's a wompus.</em> We don't know what a wompus is, but we do know that Flavia is one!</li>
